### About me

<img align='right' src='https://media.giphy.com/media/9S1CJae4qyOZGLWa4y/giphy.gif' width='200'/>

I'm a brazilian software developer :brazil:.

I'm a very curious and hard-working person, so here you can find projects of different languages and "types", including mobile, backend, data science and some frontend stuff.

I've had the opportunity to work with languages like Elixir, RoR, NodeJS and PHP, but I'm always open to new languages.

I'm currently working on things related to Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, VIM, Go, Swift, Python and Java.

I love studying and understanding more about software architecture and performance.

You can find projects with names and themes related to anime or geek things :-)
